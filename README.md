# Hi, I’m Vinayak Singh 👋

I’m a **Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React**, with a strong product and UX focus. I build **scalable, performance-conscious frontend applications** where state management, data flow, and user experience are treated as first-class concerns.

I enjoy working on complex frontend problems — especially **data-heavy interfaces, planning tools, dashboards, and workflow-driven UIs** — and turning unclear requirements into systems that are intuitive, maintainable, and reliable in production.

## 🚧 Currently Building

- **Terminal-Driven Resume + Portfolio**  
  A React-based portfolio using a CLI-style interface to explore projects, experience, and system design decisions progressively.

- **QR → UPI Payment Helper**  
  A UX-focused utility that extracts UPI payment details from QR images and opens native UPI payment flows, solving real-world gallery scan limitations.

_(This section is actively updated as I build new things.)_

## 🧠 Frontend Focus (Right Now)

- React (modern patterns & performance)
- TypeScript for predictable systems
- State-heavy, data-driven UIs
- UX for real user workflows
- Frontend performance optimization

## 🧩 How I Think About Frontend Engineering

- Prefer **simple, predictable systems** over clever abstractions  
- UX clarity matters more than visual polish  
- Performance issues are product issues  
- Frontend engineering is about **trust and reliability**, not just UI

I’m interested in senior frontend roles where I can own meaningful UI systems, work closely with product teams, and contribute to long-term technical quality.

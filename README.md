# Hi, I'm Vinayak Singh.

I am a **Senior Frontend Developer** focused on building resilient, product-centric web applications. I specialize in **React**, **TypeScript**, and modern UI architecture, treating the frontend not just as a display layer but as a complete product ecosystem.

My work emphasizes **simplicity**, **performance**, and **UX clarity**, ensuring technical solutions tackle real-world problems effectively.

### Currently Building

- **AQI Tracker**: A real-time air quality dashboard featuring detailed pollutant breakdowns and city-wise rankings. Built with **React 19**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Open-Meteo**, focusing on data accuracy and performant caching strategies.
- **Terminal Portfolio**: An interactive, CLI-style personal website built to explore React 19 capabilities and keyboard-first UX.
- **UPI Payment Helper**: A mobile utility solving the friction between gallery-saved QR codes and payment apps.

*(This section tracks my active technical experiments and product work.)*

### Frontend Focus

- **React Ecosystem**: Architecting scalable component systems, custom hooks, and leveraging modern React features (App Router, Server Actions).
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring robustness and maintainability through strict typing and clear interfaces.
- **Product & UX**: Ownership of the end-to-end user journey, from performance optimization to interaction design.
- **Design Systems**: Implementing coherent, themeable UI systems (Tailwind CSS) that scale.

### Selected Projects

**[Terminal Portfolio](https://portfolio-lime-rho-xjq08nv0tl.vercel.app/)**
A React-based command-line interface for the web. This project abandons traditional navigation for a terminal experience, featuring command parsing, filesystem navigation, and a focus on power-user interactions.

**QR → UPI Payment Helper**
A utility application addressing a specific gap in the UPI payment workflow. It streamlines the process of paying via gallery-stored QR codes, prioritizing speed and mobile usability.

### How I Think About Frontend Engineering

- **Simplicity Wins**: The best code is clear, readable, and boring. Complexity is a cost that must be justified.
- **UX First**: Performance and reliability are core components of the user experience, not afterthoughts.
- **Ownership**: A senior engineer owns the outcome, not just the task. I care deeply about the "why" behind the code.
